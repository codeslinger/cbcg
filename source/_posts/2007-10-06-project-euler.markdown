My friend [Kyle](http://kyle-burton.livejournal.com) recently turned me on to [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/). The site is a forum and list of problems and is a great way to get you into some math and numerics hacking examples. The problems are supposedly all solvable by a reasonably-powered computer in about a minute but there's no proviso for you being able to code up the solution to them in that short a time :) You don't get to see the forum for a particular problem until you've submitted the right answer to that problem, though, so it encourages you to work out at least a brute force solution before seeing what others did.

I'm pretty surprised at how many people chose "Assembler" as their preferred language. Me, I'm not that hardcore: I'm posting my [problem solutions in Ruby](http://cbcg.net/projecteuler/) as I finish each problem.
