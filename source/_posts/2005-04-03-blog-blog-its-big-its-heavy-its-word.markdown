As for the subject line, my wife IM'd this to me after I told her I was reading a "blog" by [Nick Schulz](http://www.corante.com/transition/). I was cracking up LMFAO... anyway, check out that blog; lot of interesting sports-related stuff on there.

Interestingly enough, he links to an article in which writer [Malcolm Gladwell](http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=merron/050203) is interviewed about his (at the time) upcoming book [Blink](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0316172324/qid=1112544074/sr=8-1/ref=pd_csp_1/002-7791080-7942425?v=glance&s=books&n=507846). The interview happened right before this year's Super Bowl, and Malcolm indicates that he would like to see Reid employ the no-huddle offense in order to throw Belicheck off kilter. My co-workers said the same thing after the game was over, albeit for slightly different reasons. Too bad Andy and the Iggles didn't read that before meeting up with the Pats.

Personally, I'd like to see a study on how many people watch the Super Bowl just to see the commercials; I know that's why I watch...
