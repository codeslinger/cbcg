<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">
<p>So what does a Journeyman Programming Language need? It needs to have a few general characteristics:
</p>
<ul>
<li>It has to be simple enough in syntax and conceptual framework that people not in the top 10% of the profession can feel comfortable working with it.</li>
  <li>It has to be flexible enough to cover the amount of back-end, rich GUI, web app, and systems programming that goes on in the industry.</li>
  <li>It has to make simple, common programming errors (memory allocation, array bounds, etc.) difficult or impossible.</li>
  <li>It has to make it easy for Journeyman Programmers to change projects or jobs on a regular basis.</li>
</ul>
