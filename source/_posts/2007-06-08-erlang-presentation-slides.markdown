I just gave a [presentation about the Erlang programming language](http://cbcg.net/talks/erlang.pdf) to the [Philly Linux User Group](http://www.phillylinux.org/) on Wednesday night. The slides are available in the first link. It was an introductory talk focused towards a programming-oriented group. Let me know what you think.
