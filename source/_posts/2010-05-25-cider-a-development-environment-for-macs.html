<p>Cider is a fully managed development environment for open source
          hacking on Mac OSX.  It's powered by 
          <a href="http://rvm.beginrescueend.com" rel="nofollow">rvm</a>,
          <a href="http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/" rel="nofollow">homebrew</a> and
          <a href="http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Home" rel="nofollow">chef</a>.
          You only need
          <a href="http://developer.apple.com/technologies/xcode.html" rel="nofollow">Xcode</a>
          to get started.
        </p></p><p><p>
          Cider builds everything up in ~/Developer.  It won't stomp on any of
          your current installations so you don't have to commit your entire
          machine to cider immediately.  It's a breeze to rollback if you
          really want to.</p>
