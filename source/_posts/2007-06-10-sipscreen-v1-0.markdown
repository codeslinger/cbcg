My buddy [mct](http://michael.toren.net) just created an awesome little piece of software called [sipscreen](http://michael.toren.net/code/sipscreen/) which allows you to filter out VoIP calls based on rules of your own choosing on your Linux gateway.

Here are some example call policy rules:

``` sh
exit 1 if $name =~ /TOLL FREE CALL/i or $number =~ /^(800|877)-/;                                                                                                          
exit 1 if $number eq "000-000-0000" and $hour >= 3 and $hour <= 9;                                                                                                         
exit 0;
```

If you're using VoIP and have it connected to a Linux gateway, you should definitely check this out. Its way easier to accept/reject calls than having to fire up a full [Asterisk](http://www.asterisk.org/) install.
