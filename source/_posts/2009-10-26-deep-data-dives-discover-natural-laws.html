<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">Conventional machine learning systems usually aim to generate
              predictive models that might, for example, calculate the future
              position of a pendulum given its current position. However, the
              equations unearthed by Lipson and Schmidt represented basic
              invariant relationships—such as the conservation of
              energy—of the kind that govern the behavior of the
              universe.</blockquote></p><p><div class="posterous_quote_citation">via <a href="http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2009/11/48443-deep-data-dives-discover-natural-laws/fulltext" rel="nofollow">cacm.acm.org</a>
