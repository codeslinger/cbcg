<div class="posterous_bookmarklet_entry">
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">The engineering culture at Twitter requires tests.  Lots of tests.  I haven't had formal experience with JavaScript testing before Twitter, so I've been learning a lot as I go.    In particular, a number of patterns I used to use, write about, and encourage have turned out to be bad for writing testable code.  So I thought it would be worthwhile to share a few of the most important principles I've developed for writing testable JavaScript.  The examples I provide are based on <a href="http://docs.jquery.com/QUnit" rel="nofollow">QUnit</a>, but should be just as applicable to any JavaScript testing framework.</blockquote></p><p><div class="posterous_quote_citation">via <a href="http://www.adequatelygood.com/2010/7/Writing-Testable-JavaScript" rel="nofollow">adequatelygood.com</a>
