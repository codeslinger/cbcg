<p>There are different approaches for getting to the user's credentials, I will present the easiest here and I will concentrate on iOS:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We register a custom NSURLProtocol for 'keylogger://' URLs. It is a dummy implementation which just makes sure that those URLs aren't processed further by the framework.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the webView:didFinishLoad: method, inject some JavaScript into the loaded page. The JavaScript will attach a listener to every input element on the page and that listener will call a 'keylogger://' URL crafted by us which contains the character the user entered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the shouldStartLoadWithRequest: method, we capture all of the 'keylogger://' requests and log the characters. Then we stop loading, because those URLs are just used to communicate between JS and Objective-C.</p>
