<strong>PAYPAL:</strong> Only a nonprofit can use the Donate button.<br /><strong>ME:</strong> That’s false.  It says right in the PDF of instructions for the Donate button that it can be used for “worthy causes.”<br /><strong>PAYPAL:</strong> I haven’t seen that PDF. And what you’re doing is not a worthy cause, it’s charity.<br /><strong>ME:</strong> What’s the difference?<br /><strong>PAYPAL:</strong> <em>You can use the donate button to raise money for a sick cat, but not poor people.</em>
