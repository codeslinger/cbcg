I just tried [Acquisition](http://www.acquisitionx.com/), a new P2P app from the same guy who brought you NewsFire, Mr. David Watanabe. It looks nice, but I already uninstalled it since it crashed twice in 30 seconds, before I could even attempt to download anything. I also don't really understand why he's charging for a beta product, but at least you know he's going to charge for this one from the start. ;-)
