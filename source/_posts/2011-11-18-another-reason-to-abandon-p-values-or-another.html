<p>The Sample Size Extender™ is so easy a child could use it.  Here’s how it works.   All you need is a theory: any will do, the wilder the better.  Begin collecting your data, put them through the works one at a time, then just wait for the publishable p-value, which is sure to come.</p>
<p>Here’s an example. Your theory supposes that a certain measure will be different between two groups.  You’ll confirm this using a t-test—though any test will do.  You begin by measuring two people, one from each group<sup>1</sup>.  Put the measurements of this pair into the t-test and check whether your p-value is less than the magic number.  If it is: stop!  Your theory is proven.  Go forth and write your paper. </p>
<p>But if the p-value is not small enough, measure two more people, one more from each group.  Then run the augmented sample through the t-test and check for a publishable p-value again.  </p>
<p>Iterate the Sample Size Extender™ and you will always—absolutely always—find a p-value less than the magic number.  Yes, sir, friends: this method is foolproof. Fools prove it every day!</p>
