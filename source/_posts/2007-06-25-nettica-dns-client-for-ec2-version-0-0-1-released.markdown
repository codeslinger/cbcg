I've just released by code to update EC2 instances on start up and shut down with the Nettica DNS service. You can find it here:

[http://code.google.com/p/netticadns/](http://code.google.com/p/netticadns/)

With this code, you can set up your EC2 instances to automatically register/deregister themselves with the Nettica DNS service on start up and shut down. There's no RPM packaging at this point, but there is a dpkg available for it.

I'd appreciate any feedback or patches. Have fun with it.
