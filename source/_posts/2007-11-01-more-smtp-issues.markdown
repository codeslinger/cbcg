This is getting really old, really fast. Now the Charlotte hotel I am staying in also proxies port 25 and fails to proxy SMTP AUTH. WTF? And they are using Symantec Mail Security, a product from the division where I used to work! Sheesh... Anyway, its really Mailstreet's fault for not listening on 587 in the first place.
