<p>Here's an experiment anyone can do: Go get your Apple IR
          remote.  The LED emits at 980nm, or about 306THz, in the
          near-IR spectrum.  Relatively speaking, this is just outside
          of the visible range. Take the remote into the basement, or
          the darkest room in your house, in the middle of the night,
          with the lights off.  Let your eyes adjust to the
          blackness.</p></p><p><img src="http://people.xiph.org/~xiphmont/demo/neil-young.html/apple-ir.jpg" /><div class="caption">
	    <p>Above: Apple IR remote photographed using a digital
	    camera.  Though the emitter is quite bright and the
	    frequency emitted is not far past the red portion of
	    the visible spectrum, it's completely invisible to the
	    eye.</p>

          [<a href="http://people.xiph.org/~xiphmont/demo/neil-young.html#foot4" rel="nofollow">4</a>]?  No?  Not even the tiniest amount?
          Try a few other IR remotes; most use an IR wavelength even
          closer to the visible band, around 310-320THz.  You won't be
          able to see them either, even though they would be
          blindingly, painfully bright if they were in the visible
          spectrum.</p></p><p><div class="caption">

          frequency limit.  192kHz audio extends to 400% of the
          audible limit.  Lest I be accused of comparing apples and
          oranges, auditory and visual perception drop off similarly
          toward the edges.</p>
