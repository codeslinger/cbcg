<p>vfuncs is a library for semi-functional style coding with vector verbs in ansi C. It includes functions to allow higher level verb-like programming with simple in memory arrays. </p>
<p>The code could be useful for prototyping and development of signal analyzing time series data in finance, bioinformatics, stats, and was motivated largely as an experiment to write readable C code which has reasonably good performance - currently does gaussian filter across 6-million points per second. </p>
<p>It includes for example implementations of Marsaglias random number generators and a simple digital filter implementation. </p>
<p>Inspired partly by K, Q and other functional languages, and the open source tool R.</p>

    <p>Looks like this could be really neat stuff.</p>
