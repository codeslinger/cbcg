<p>Some telling symptoms of <em>Second Startup Syndrome</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The company assumes that the first product will succeed and spends more time figuring out business models and monetization strategies than developing the core product idea.</li>
<li>The company becomes obsessed with the things that went wrong in their last company and focuses entirely on how to rid the new company of these mistakes. If the previous company was successful, the entrepreneurs often ignore what went right and focus on what went wrong.</li>
<li>The company glosses over important details assuming that what worked the first time will automagically work the second time.</li>
</ul>
