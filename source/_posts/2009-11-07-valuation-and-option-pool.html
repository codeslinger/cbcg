<p>One of the more contentious things in the negotiation between an entrepreneur and a VC over a financing, particularly an early stage financing, is the inclusion of an option pool in the pre-money valuation. As my friend <a href="http://markpincus.typepad.com/" rel="nofollow">Mark Pincus</a> likes to say, "it's just another way to lower the price".</p>
<p>I'll accept that critique. And take it one step further. The option pool is absolutely a piece of the price negotiation. But it is a very important one as I'll explain.</p>
