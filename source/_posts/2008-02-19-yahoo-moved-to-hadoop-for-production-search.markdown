title: Yahoo! Moved to Hadoop for Production Search

Today a real validation for the [Hadoop](http://lucene.apache.org/hadoop) effort came in the form of [Yahoo!](http://www.yahoo.com) announcing that [their production search is now running on Hadoop](http://developer.yahoo.com/blogs/hadoop/2008/02/yahoo-worlds-largest-production-hadoop.html). This should go a long way to allaying others' concerns about Hadoop's speed, stability or scalability. Cheers, Yahoo!: You've done some excellent work!
