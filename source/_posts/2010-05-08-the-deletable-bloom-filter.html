<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">We introduce the Deletable Bloom filter (DlBF) as a new spin on the popular
data structure based on compactly encoding the information of where collisions
happen when inserting elements. The DlBF design enables false-negative-free
deletions at a fraction of the cost in memory consumption, which turns to be
appealing for certain probabilistic filter applications</blockquote></p><p><div class="posterous_quote_citation">via <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1005.0352" rel="nofollow">arxiv.org</a>
