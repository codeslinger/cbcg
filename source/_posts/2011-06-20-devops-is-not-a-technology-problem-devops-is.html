<p>I've spent the <a href="http://dev2ops.org/blog/2010/2/22/what-is-devops.html" rel="nofollow">past nine months or so</a> overcoming resistance to the DevOps movement in both public forums and inside client companies. During that time, I've begun to notice a common misconception that I think is fueling much of the negative initial reaction that some people have to DevOps ideas. I want to take a shot at clearing it up now:</p>
<p>DevOps is not a technology problem.</p>
<p>Technology plays a key part in enabling solutions to DevOps problems. However, DevOps itself is fundamentally a <em>business</em> problem.</p>
