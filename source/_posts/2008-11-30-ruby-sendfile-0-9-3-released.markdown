I got a patch this afternoon from one [Damon Morda](http://www.linkedin.com/in/damonmorda) which fixed ruby-sendfile to compile again on Mac OS X Leopard. I've included his patch and done a new release of ruby-sendfile which is now available via RubyGems (you can get the source tarball from [Rubyforge](http://rubyforge.org/projects/ruby-sendfile/)).
