<p>Since the emerging of Hadoop implementation, I have been trying to morph existing algorithms from various areas into the map/reduce model.  The result is pretty encouraging and I've found Map/Reduce is applicable in a wide spectrum of application scenarios.</p>
<p>So I want to write down my findings but then found the scope is too broad and also I haven't spent enough time to explore different problem domains.  Finally, I realize that there is no way for me to completely cover what Map/Reduce can do in all areas, so I just dump out what I know at this moment over the long weekend when I have an extra day.</p>
