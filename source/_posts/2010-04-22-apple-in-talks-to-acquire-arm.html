<p>Apple is ARM's biggest customer and speculation is that the <a href="http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/related-98273-apple-ipad.do" rel="nofollow">iPad</a> maker wants to take chip design in house.</p>
<p>“A deal would make a lot of sense for Apple,” said one trader. “That way, they could stop ARM's technology from ending up in everyone else's computers and gadgets.” Traders reckon a bid would come in at around 400p a share, valuing ARM at more than £5.2 billion.</p>

    <p>This would be really, really bad for competition in the mobile market. I really hope this doesn't happen.</p>
