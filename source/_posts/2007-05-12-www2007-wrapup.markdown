Wow, that was a really great conference. I met a bunch of people there, saw a few I already knew from other fields and listened to some great talks. I wasn't sure if I was going to feel that it was good enough to entertain thoughts of hitting next year's conference in Beijing, but now I just might.

Also, I saw some more good talks yesterday:

[Scaling Up All Pairs Similarity Search](http://www2007.org/program/paper.php?id=342)

[Exposing Private Information by Timing Web Applications](http://www2007.org/program/paper.php?id=555)

[On Anonymizing Query Logs via Token-based Hashing](http://www2007.org/program/paper.php?id=582)

Those are just some that were really good.  I also have a stack that I want to read but who's talks I missed. I'll post the pics I took with the phone when I get off this damn airplane.
