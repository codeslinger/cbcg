<p>Gave a presentation on <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/cassandra" rel="nofollow">Cassandra</a> tonight at <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/philly-lambda" rel="nofollow">Philly Lambda</a>. The slides are <a href="http://cbcg.net/talks.html" rel="nofollow">on this page</a> but they may be a bit light without the associated speech ;-) Thanks to all the people that came out tonight!</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Turns out Eric Brewer not only worked at Inktomi, but was co-founder and Chief Scientist there. I got confused because he used his Berkeley address on the CAP paper. My bad :(</p>
