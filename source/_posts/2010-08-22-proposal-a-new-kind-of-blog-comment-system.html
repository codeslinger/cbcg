<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">I'm almost 100 percent sure that scripting.com was the first blog to have comments. And I'm equally sure that it was the first to have its comments flame out. The flameout was a good thing, although it didn't feel like it at the time, because it created the first wave of blogs. And when <i>their</i> comments flamed out, there were subsequent waves of new blogs.</blockquote></p><p><div class="posterous_quote_citation">via <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2010/08/22/proposalANewKindOfBlogComm.html" rel="nofollow">scripting.com</a>
