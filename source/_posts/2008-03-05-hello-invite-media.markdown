After taking some time off and assessing my options, I've accepted the post of Chief Architect at [Invite Media](http://www.invitemedia.com) out here in Philadelphia. They are an early stage startup still in stealth mode and they are doing some off-the-wall cool stuff. I'm really excited to be working with such a great team of people and looking forward to helping them out in any way I can.
