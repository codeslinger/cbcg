<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">This is a tale of three images. I found these images while investigating the internals of several different applications. There are some really neat software projects emerging at the moment, and as a developer I always find it interesting to take a look at the implementation details, because there is often a lot to be learned. It’s not always something you might need right now, but maybe a few years down the line you may be confronted with a similar problem. Plus – in my opinion – knowing a bit about the internals of a program helps reasoning about its behaviour.</blockquote></p><p><div class="posterous_quote_citation">via <a href="http://eclipsesource.com/blogs/2009/12/13/persistent-trees-in-git-clojure-and-couchdb-data-structure-convergence/" rel="nofollow">eclipsesource.com</a>
