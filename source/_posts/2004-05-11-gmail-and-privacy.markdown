I just wanted to weigh on GMail real quick.

It seems to me as if Google is getting slammed for privacy concerns relating to GMail because they are actually good at what they do. MSN and Yahoo! have the same characteristics (or worse) and no one is passing laws to ban those services. GMail can be used, or not, by the individual consumer, which is where the choice really lies anyway. It seems as if Google is being punished in the court of public opinion simply because they can't write a good initial press release... they've since clarified that email you delete will, in fact, be deleted. So what's the problem, California?
