<em><strong>Modern GPU</strong></em> is a set of GPU computing programs and companion articles. The articles form a tutorial and cover the programs as case studies.  GPGPU literature has avoided coverage of functions requiring complex inter-thread communication, favoring algorithms that have obvious parallelizations. But these are not the most interesting problems in this emerging field.</blockquote></p><p><div class="posterous_quote_citation">via <a href="http://www.moderngpu.com/" rel="nofollow">moderngpu.com</a>
