title: ruby-epoll alpha released
layout: post

I just finished the first release of [ruby-epoll](http://cbcg.net/code/ruby-epoll-ALPHA001.tar.bz2). There's no documentation yet, but there is an example chat server to give you an idea of how to use it. Things to do:

* Add documentation
* Get it up on RubyForge
* Fix bugs
* Add some esoteric features that might help make it more scalable

ruby-epoll is released under an MIT license.

Try it out and let me know how it breaks for you (Linux 2.6+ kernel with epoll(4) support required to build and use).
