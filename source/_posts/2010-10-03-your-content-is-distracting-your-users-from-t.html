<p>As you can see, revenue increased significantly from September 23th because the CTR went over the roof, reaching almost 10% some days (for those not familiar with in-app advertising, 10% is ridiculously high, usual rates are 1-2%). Next thing I did was opening the application to check the ads. If 10% of the time users were clicking on the ads, they have to be really cool!<br /></p>
<p>To my surprise, I found the app was not working. Nothing at all, no content. What?!</p>
