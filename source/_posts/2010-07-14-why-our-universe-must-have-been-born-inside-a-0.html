<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">Another important by-product of Poplawski's approach is that it makes it possible for universes to be born inside the event horizons of certain kinds of black hole. Here, torsion prevents the formation of a singularity but allows a HUGE energy density to build up, which leads to the creation of particles on a massive scale via pair production followed by the expansion of the new universe.</blockquote></p><p><div class="posterous_quote_citation">via <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/blog/arxiv/25430/" rel="nofollow">technologyreview.com</a>
