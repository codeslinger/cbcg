title: Please don't alert based on percentages

<blockquote><div></p><p><p>One of the classic mistakes made by monitoring and alerting systems is
to alert based on percentages; if something registers at 90% or 95% or
whatever, it raises various sorts of alerts. This is a terrible mistake.</p></p><p><p>(The people who write these monitoring systems love percentage based
alerts because they're so easy to do, which in my cynical view is why
lots of monitoring systems ship with them.)</p></p><p><p>The easiest way to see the problem of percentage based alerts is to
consider disk space monitoring. Suppose the system alerts based on a
filesystem reaching 95% full. Does this give you useful information?</p></p><p><p>Well, no. First, it doesn't tell you how much disk space is left. 95%
full on a 50 GByte filesystem is very much different than 95% full on
a 1.5 TByte filesystem; in fact, at 95% used the 1.5 TB filesystem has
more free space than the entire 50 GByte filesystem ever had. Filesystem
space is one of those cases where you usually care more about absolute
numbers than about percentages.</p></p><p><p>Second, even simple space used doesn't actually tell you if you should
panic. What generally matters is not that some quantity has reached an
arbitrary value, what matters is whether or not you are going to run
out of capacity at some point in the near future. To have some idea of
that, you need to know not just the current capacity left but how fast
capacity has been consumed. 50 Gbytes free at a space growth rate of 256
Mbytes a day is very different from 50 Gbytes free at a space growth
rate of 10 Gbytes a day; you ignore the former (unless you have a very
long lead time on getting space) but you really want to pay attention to
the latter because you only have a few days left to get more space.</p></p><p><p>(Similarly you care both about the long term trend rate and any short
term deviations from it because both of them can cause you problems.)</p></p><p><p>Similar issues apply to pretty much any other metric you may be
monitoring. Doing useful alerts about capacity problems is just not
amenable to simple percentage based solutions, because such solutions
are not answering a useful question. If you want to make useful alerts,
they should generally at least be based on intelligently chosen absolute
numbers.</p>
