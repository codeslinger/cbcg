<div class="posterous_bookmarklet_entry">
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">The story of how GPU came to be used for high-performance computation is pretty cool. Hardware heavily optimized for graphics turned out to be useful for another use: certain types of high-performance computations. In this article, I will explore how and why this happened, and summarize the state of general computation on GPUs today.</blockquote></p><p><div class="posterous_quote_citation">via <a href="http://igoro.com/archive/how-gpu-came-to-be-used-for-general-computation/" rel="nofollow">igoro.com</a>
