<blockquote class="posterous_long_quote">We've all been there - you're wandering around a party at some Linux
event clutching your drink and looking for someone to talk to, but
everyone is having some obscure technical conversation full of
unfamiliar jargon.  Then, as you slide past a cluster of
important-looking people, you overhear the word "superblock" and
think, "Superblock, that's a file system thing... I read about file
systems in operating systems class once."  Gratefully, you join the
conversation, only to discover while you know some of the terms -
cylinder group, indirect block, inode - you're still unable to come up
with stunning ripostes like, "Aha, but that's really just another
version of soft updates, and it doesn't solve the nlinks problem."
(Admiring silence ensues.) Now what?  You want to be able to make
witty remarks about the pros and cons of journaling while throwing
back the last of your martini, but you don't know where to start.</blockquote></p><p><div class="posterous_quote_citation">via <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/196292/" rel="nofollow">lwn.net</a>
