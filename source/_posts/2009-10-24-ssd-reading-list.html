 SSD Reading List 
 2009/10/18 
<p>As part of the preparatory work of replacing BerkeleyDB with our own storage engine in <a href="http://scalien.com" rel="nofollow">Keyspace</a>, I've been looking at papers about SSD technology. It looks like SSDs will replace spinning disks in a couple of years, and in anticipation of this we're looking into the possibility of optimizing the engine for its characteristics: cheap random reads, potentially expensive writes because of erases behind complex on-disk logic called the Flash Tranlation Layer (FTL). Here are some good resources I found.</p>

</ol>
<p> </p>
<p>Two notes: First, the uFLIP paper is particularly good. Second, it seems that the In-Page Logging (IPL) paper assumes direct control of read/write/erase cycles of the SSD, which is not realistic for off-the-shelf consumer drives like the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=intel%20x25m&amp;aq=f&amp;oq=&amp;aqi=" rel="nofollow">Intel X25-M</a>, which include a complex FTL.</p>
<p>Finally, while putting together this list I found a much <a href="http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~jpq/flash.html" rel="nofollow">longer list of SSD papers here</a>, also worth taking a look.</p>

<p>Great list of reading material to get some excellent background on the particulars of the new SSDs coming to market. I agree with the author, the Anandtech overview is definitely a must-read and a great place to start.</p>
