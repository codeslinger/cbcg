Google just [posted a paper about BigTable](http://labs.google.com/papers/bigtable.html) in advance of the OSDI 2006 conference where they will be presenting on the topic. This fills out a lot of information for me that I hadn't known at the time I did my [Google Internals](http://cbcg.net/talks/googleinternals) talk at [PLUG](http://phillylinux.org) last month. Definitely check it out if you want to read about a pretty cool distributed database system.
