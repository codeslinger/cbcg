<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">From my point of view, the big problem I found on this release (which I just installed 5 minutes ago) is that they changed the window buttons from the right to the left side of the window. I think 95% of the users are used to the buttons on the right side, and I donâ€™t see the point on moving them to the left.</blockquote></p><p><div class="posterous_quote_citation">via <a href="http://www.codigomanso.com/en/2010/04/ubuntu-10-4-poner-el-boton-de-cerrar-la-ventana-a-la-derecha/" rel="nofollow">codigomanso.com</a>
