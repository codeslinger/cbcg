<div class="posterous_bookmarklet_entry">
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">There is a way to compute variance that is more accurate and is 
	guaranteed to always give positive results. Furthermore, the method computes 
	a running variance. That is, the method computes the variance as the x's 
	arrive one at a time. The data do not need to be saved for a second pass.</blockquote></p><p><div class="posterous_quote_citation">via <a href="http://www.johndcook.com/standard_deviation.html" rel="nofollow">johndcook.com</a>
