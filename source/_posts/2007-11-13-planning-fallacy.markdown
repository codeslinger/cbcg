Apparently, its not just software engineers that [can't estimate how long a project will take](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/09/planning-fallac.html). I thought maybe we were alone in that, given all of the high-tower thinkers spouting off about how other engineering disciplines always succeed in their endeavors and software rarely does. Looks like maybe no one's got it all figured out just yet, eh?

This article was especially pertinent to me now since I am responsible for coming up with these kinds of schedules at work these days. I'm not too far along in my [EBS](/blog/2007/10/27/evidence-based-scheduling) implementation but I'm hoping that can offset some of the pain of project estimation.
