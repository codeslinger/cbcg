<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">The milkshake was hired in lieu of a bagel or doughnut because it was relatively tidy and appetite-quenching, and because trying to suck a thick liquid through a thin straw gave customers something to do with their boring commute. Understanding the job to be done, the company could then respond by creating a morning milkshake that was even thicker (to last through a long commute) and more interesting (with chunks of fruit) than its predecessor. The chain could also respond to a separate job that customers needed milkshakes to do: serve as a special treat for young childrenâ€”without making the parents wait a half hour as the children tried to work the milkshake through a straw. In that case, a different, thinner milkshake was in order.</blockquote></p><p><div class="posterous_quote_citation">via <a href="http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/6496.html" rel="nofollow">hbswk.hbs.edu</a>
