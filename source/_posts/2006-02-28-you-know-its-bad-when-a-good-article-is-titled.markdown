... [Why Windows Vista won't suck](http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,1697,1931946,00.asp) 

I think this is the kind of thing that should really concern Microsoft executives. The title says it all: people will expect it to be an overpriced, underperforming piece of ____. The media and consumer market hangs all over ever word from Apple, but Microsoft has to run out and tell people why their latest product is worth spending money on. 

I hear rumors that they will try to steal Apple's thunder with an announcement of that Origami device on Thursday, but think about it: _we already know what they are going to announce._ We don't know what Apple will say. This is a no-brainer. How can you steal anyone's thunder without any element of surprise?

With press like this, you  know that you are your own worst enemy. This is exactly the kind of article they were writing about Sun a few years ago when they clearly didn't get it. Microsoft needs a makeover. Fast.
