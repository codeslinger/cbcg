At the new job, I was invited by one of the doods to an art party last night down at [Philly North Bowl](http://www.northbowlphilly.com/). Having never been to one, I went down to check it out. It was pretty awesome. The work of local artist [Todd Marrone](http://www.toddmarrone.com/) is on display down there all month, but last night he did a live painting show for us. It was black & white, but I just kept thinking how I could spend all year trying to do one of those paintings and still get it wrong, whereas he did 4 of them in less than 20 minutes. Pretty cool stuff. I'll have to see if I can check out more of that kind of thing going forward.
