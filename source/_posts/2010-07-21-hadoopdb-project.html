 HadoopDB is:
 </p><p><ol>
<li>A hybrid of DBMS and MapReduce technologies that targets analytical workloads
</li>
<li>Designed to run on a shared-nothing cluster of commodity machines, or in the cloud
</li>
<li>An attempt to fill the gap in the market for a free and open source parallel DBMS
</li>
<li>Much more scalable than currently available parallel database systems and DBMS/MapReduce hybrid systems.
</li>
<li>As scalable as Hadoop, while achieving superior performance on structured data analysis workloads</li>
</ol>
