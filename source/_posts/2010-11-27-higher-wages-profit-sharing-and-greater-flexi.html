<p>As the economy slowly recovers, it's no secret  that companies would like to boost productivity and profits. Many think  the best way to do so is to slash costs. As an entrepreneur and business  owner, though, I'd like to suggest another idea: Pay your employees more.</p>
<p>That's not as crazy as it sounds. A growing body  of evidence is revealing that companies that pay fair wages, and offer  flexibility and training to even entry-level and lower-skilled  employees, do better than those that don't. A vast number of businesses  mistakenly assume that their lowest-wage workers are easily replaced or  not worth investing in, but those that do the right thing soon find that  they're doing the right thing for their bottom lines. It's time that  this becomes a business norm.</p>
