<p>Chinese inmates in Jixi labor camp are reportedly forced to slay demons, battle goblins and cast spells in online games to farm credits for prison guards who trade virtual currencies for real money.</p>
<p>A former prison guard turned inmate, told <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/may/25/china-prisoners-internet-gaming-scam" rel="nofollow">The Guardian</a> that the operation was even more lucrative than the physical labor that prisoners were also forced to do. He shares:</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote"><p>“There were 300 prisoners forced to play games. We worked 12-hour shifts in the camp. I heard them say they could earn 5,000-6,000rmb [US $770-$925] a day. We didn’t see any of the money. The computers were never turned off.”</p></blockquote>
<p>He adds that the inmates were kept playing until they could barely see things and missing the daily quota would result in physical punishment and abuse.</p>
