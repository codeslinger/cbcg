<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">It is worse than that. B and C might have to reorganize to the extent that they <i>cease to exist</i>Â in order for the company to reap the benefits of Agile. For example, a company may no longer need a Project Management Department, because though Agile teams have leaders, they don't necessarily have project managers. Of course, the Project Management Department will oppose such changes.</blockquote></p><p><div class="posterous_quote_citation">via <a href="http://kallokain.blogspot.com/2009/11/are-nash-equilibriums-killing-agile.html" rel="nofollow">kallokain.blogspot.com</a>
