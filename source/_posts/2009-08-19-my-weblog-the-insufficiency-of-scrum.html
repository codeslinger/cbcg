<div class="posterous_bookmarklet_entry">
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">Scrum is often promoted and adopted as
a holistic software development methodology. It simply isn't. It
doesn't help us manage our project goals, and it encourages us to
build software that grows increasingly hard to change. Scrum is great
at what it is intended to do, but it only provides a subset of the
Agile practices we need to succeed.</blockquote></p><p><div class="posterous_quote_citation">via <a href="http://billschofield.typepad.com/my_weblog/2009/08/the-insufficiency-of-scrum.html" rel="nofollow">billschofield.typepad.com</a>
