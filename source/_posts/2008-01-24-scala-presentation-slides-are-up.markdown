Last night I gave a [presentation on Scala](http://cbcg.net/talks/) to the [Philly Lambda](http://groups.google.com/group/philly-lambda) group. The [slides are available here](http://cbcg.net/talks/). It was a pretty good time and about 15 people or so showed up for the talk. The space was graciously provided in the really cool-looking [Cira Centre](http://www.ciracentre.com/) down at 30th St. by Aaron Feng of [Algorithmics](http://www.algorithmics.com/). Thanks to Aaron and all who attended; I had a great time presenting!
