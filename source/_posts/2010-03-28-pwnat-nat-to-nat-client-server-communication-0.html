<div class="posterous_bookmarklet_entry">
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">
<i>pwnat</i>, pronounced "poe-nat", is a tool that allows any
    number of clients behind NATs to communicate with a
    server behind a separate NAT with *no* port forwarding
    and *no* DMZ setup on any routers in order to directly
    communicate with each other. The server does not need
    to know anything about the clients trying to connect.</p><p><b>Simply put, this is a proxy server that works behind a NAT,
    even when the client is behind a NAT, without any 3rd party.</b>

    <p>This seems really useful for new p2p projects.</p>
