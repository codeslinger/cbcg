<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">In <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/hadoop/tutorial/module5.html/module4.html" rel="nofollow">Module 4</a> you learned the basics
  of programming with Hadoop MapReduce. That module explains how
  data moves through a general MapReduce architecture, and what
  particular methods and classes facilitate the use of the
  Hadoop for processing. In this module we will look more closely
  at how to override Hadoop's functionality in various ways.
  These techniques allow you to customize Hadoop for
  application-specific purposes.</blockquote></p><p><div class="posterous_quote_citation">via <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/hadoop/tutorial/module5.html" rel="nofollow">developer.yahoo.com</a>
