<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">Physicists have replicated the finding that the subatomic particles called neutrinos seem to travel faster than light. It is a remarkable confirmation of a stunning result, yet most in the field remain sceptical that the ultimate cosmic speed limit has truly been broken.</blockquote></p><p><div class="posterous_quote_citation">via <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/neutrino-experiment-replicates-faster-than-light-finding-1.9393" rel="nofollow">nature.com</a>
