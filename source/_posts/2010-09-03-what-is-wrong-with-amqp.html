<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">Reliability is not one thing. The kind of reliability we want in a particular case is closely tied to the kind of work being done.

Messaging is not one model, it is several, and each has cost-benefit tradeoffs, and each has a specific view of what "reliable" means.</blockquote></p><p><div class="posterous_quote_citation">via <a href="http://www.imatix.com/articles:whats-wrong-with-amqp" rel="nofollow">imatix.com</a>
