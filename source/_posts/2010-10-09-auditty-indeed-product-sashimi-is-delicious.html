<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">This workshop was all about learning how to "slice a product thinly" so that you can actually ship something of value quickly. We also spent a lot of time working on how to help turn a fuzzy customer product idea into something concrete that you can start to work on. I summarized it to my team like this: You customer comes in and they are usually asking for a whale. At the end of the project what they really wanted was a crab. Your job is to start from their request for a whale and 1) trim the whale down to the meaty parts they really want/need and 2) slice that meaty part thinly so that you can actually start development and deliver value soon.</blockquote></p><p><div class="posterous_quote_citation">via <a href="http://audittyindeed.blogspot.com/2010/10/product-sashimi-is-delicious.html?spref=tw" rel="nofollow">audittyindeed.blogspot.com</a>
