<p>I really enjoy reverse engineering stuff. I also really like playing video
games. Sometimes, I get bored and start wondering how the video game I'm
playing works internally. Last year, this led me to analyze <em>Tales of Symphonia
2</em>, a Wii RPG. This game uses a custom virtual machine with some really
interesting features (including cooperative multithreading) in order to
describe cutscenes, maps, etc. I started to be very interested in how this
virtual machine worked, and wrote a (mostly) complete implementation of this
virtual machine in C++.</p>
<p>However, I recently discovered that some other games are also using this same
virtual machine for their own scripts. I was quite interested by that fact and
started analyzing scripts for these games and trying to find all the
improvements between versions of the virtual machine. Three days ago, I started
working on <em>Tales of Vesperia</em> (PS3) scripts, which seem to be compiled in the
same format as I analyzed before. Unfortunately, every single file in the
scripts directory seemed to be compressed using an unknown compression format,
using the magic number "TLZC".</p>
