<p>After that discussion, a more realistic mapping would seem to be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create = PUT iff you are sending the full content of the specified resource (URL).</li>
<li>Create = POST if you are sending a command to the server to create a subordinate of the specified resource, using some server-side algorithm.</li>
<li>Retrieve = GET.</li>
<li>Update = PUT iff you are updating the full content of the specified resource.</li>
<li>Update = POST if you are requesting the server to update one or more subordinates of the specified resource.</li>
<li>Delete = DELETE.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>NOTE: “iff” means “if and only if”.</em></p>
