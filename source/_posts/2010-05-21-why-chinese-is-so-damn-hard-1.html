title: Why Chinese Is So Damn Hard

<div class="posterous_bookmarklet_entry">
<blockquote class="posterous_long_quote">Everyone's heard the supposed fact that if you take the English
         idiom "It's Greek to me" and search for equivalent idioms in all
         the world's languages to arrive at a consensus as to which
         language is the hardest, the results of such a linguistic survey
         is that Chinese easily wins as the canonical incomprehensible
         language. (For example, the French have the expression "<i>C'est
         du chinois</i>", "It's Chinese", i.e., "It's incomprehensible".
         Other languages have similar sayings.) So then the question
         arises: What do the Chinese <i>themselves</i> consider to be an
         impossibly hard language? You then look for the corresponding
         phrase in Chinese, and you find <span class="py">Gēn
         tiānshū yíyàng</span>
         <span class="py">跟天书一样</span>
         meaning "It's like heavenly script."</blockquote></p><p><div class="posterous_quote_citation">via <a href="http://www.pinyin.info/readings/texts/moser.html" rel="nofollow">pinyin.info</a>

    <p>Hmm, interesting. I was planning on trying to learn Chinese one of these days... maybe I will need more time than I had originally thought ;-)</p>
