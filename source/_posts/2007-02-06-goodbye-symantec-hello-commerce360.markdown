title: Goodbye Symantec, Hello Commerce360
layout: post
---
I've left [Symantec](http://www.symantec.com/). My last day there is this Friday. I'm taking a position as the Senior Director of Technology, Chief Architect at [Commerce360](http://www.commerce360.com/).

It was a good run there, a little over 5 years from the start of ePrivacy Group to the time I decided to leave. I made a lot of new friends and learned a whole lot while I was there. But, now I think its time to move on to bigger and better challenges. It should be a lot of fun at Commerce360 and I'm really looking forward to taking my shot at contributing.
