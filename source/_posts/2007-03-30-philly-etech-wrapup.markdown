Well, the [Philly Emerging Technologies for the Enterprise](http://www.phillyemergingtech.com/) conference finished yesterday and boy was it fun. I had a great time watching the talks, meeting [new](http://geoffreygrosenbach.com/) [people](http://www.slash7.com/), seeing some [old](http://whatcomesnext.brussin.com/) [friends](http://www.rubypal.com/) and just generally hanging out.

I thought Geoffrey Grossenbach's talk on [unobtrusive Javascript](http://www.ujs4rails.com/) was great on Wednesday. This is a pretty useful technique to employ and something that typically gets short shrift in a lot of Web apps. Also, [Amy Hoy](http://www.slash7.com/)'s talk on user interface design was first class. There was a lot of material in there I had never even thought about: form separation, slow readers on the Web, the placement of submit buttons, etc. Once the slides go up you should definitely check them out.

I also gave a talk on [Comet](http://cbcg.net/talks/comet/) which, as far as people tell me, wasn't a complete disaster. I got presentation envy right near my talk after realizing that everyone I had seen so far had at least twice as many slides as I did. There were lots of questions at the end, though, so I'm assuming people were awake for at least part of what I was saying. I was videotaped for the talk so that might appear up here in the future, too.

All in all, it was a really good conference, very smoothly run and I had a blast. Thanks, [Chariot Solutions](http://www.chariotsolutions.com/)!
