<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">In short, these games try to get people to pay cash for in game currency so they can level up faster and have a better overall experience. Which is fine. But for users who won’t pay cash, a wide variety of “offers” are available where they can get in-game currency in exchange for lead gen-type offers. Most of these offers are bad for consumers because it confusingly gets them to pay far more for in-game currency than if they just paid cash (there are notable exceptions, but the scammy stuff tends to crowd out the legitimate offers). And it’s also bad for legitimate advertisers.</blockquote></p><p><div class="posterous_quote_citation">via <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/10/31/scamville-the-social-gaming-ecosystem-of-hell/" rel="nofollow">techcrunch.com</a>

    <p>These games are worthless, anyway. Who is playing them?</p>
