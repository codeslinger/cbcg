Here's an [excellent interview from DrunkenBlog with John 'The Wolf' Rentzsch](http://www.drunkenblog.com/drunkenblog-archives/000513.html), Mac hacker extraordinaire. Really interesting stuff about mach_inject and mach_override, two of John's many super hacks. Check out the links at the bottom for more info.

Also linked from that article is another DrunkenBlog gem; a dissertation about [why SMP is made more difficult by Apple's choice to bolt FreeBSD onto a Mach microkernel](http://www.drunkenblog.com/drunkenblog-archives/000385.html). DrunkenBlog continues to impress.
