Having just come off of 5 years in anti-spam, an idea like [this one](http://presto.com/) strikes me as hilariously dumb. Here's how I see this one playing out:

_Printing noise from the kitchen during Grandma's weekly bridge game..._

_Grandma:_ Ooh, I must be getting some new pictures from my daughter of the grandkids on their vacation to DisneyWorld!

_Four women cozy into the kitchen to see a piece of porn image spam printing out..._

_Grandma's friend:_ DisneyWorld sure has changed since last time I was there...

Economics, people. Economics.
