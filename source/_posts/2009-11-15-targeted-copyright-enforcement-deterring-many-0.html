<p>This situation has two stable outcomes, one in which nobody cheats, and the other in which everybody cheats.    The everybody-cheats outcome is stable because each player figures that he has only a 1/26 chance of facing enforcement, and a 1/26 chance of losing $10 is not enough to scare him away from the $1 he can get by cheating.</p>
<p>It might seem that deterrence doesn't work because the cheaters have safety in numbers.    It might seem that deterrence can only succeed by raising the penalty to more than $26.   But here comes Kleiman and Kilmer's clever trick.</p>
<p>The enforcer gets everyone together and says, "Listen up, A through Z.   From now on, I'm going to punish the cheater who comes first in the alphabet."     Now A will stop cheating, because he knows he'll face certain punishment if he cheats.    B, knowing that A won't cheat, will then realize that if <i>he</i> cheats, he'll face certain punishment, so B will stop cheating.   Now C, knowing that A and B won't cheat, will reason that he had better stop cheating too.   And so on ... with the result that nobody will cheat.</p>

    <p>Interesting application of game theory. Hope the RIAA is dumb enough not to use it.</p>
