<p>A few months ago we published a blog post that talked about our servers doing 1 million tcp connections on a single box: <a href="http://blog.whatsapp.com/?p=170" rel="nofollow">http://blog.whatsapp.com/?p=170</a></p>
<p>Today we have an update for those keeping score at home: we are nowÂ able to easily push our systems to over 2 million tcp connections!</p>

    <p>Very impressive numbers, if only in exploiting the awesome hardware they have available. I wish I could run on dual hex-cores with 96GB RAM ;-) I wonder if they even need two boxes with a setup like this for connection concentration.</p>
