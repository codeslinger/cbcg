<dd>Many people have used random number generators in their programs to create unpredictability, make the motion and
behavior of objects appear more natural, or generate textures. Random number generators certainly have their uses,
but at times their output can be too harsh to appear natural. This article will present a function which has a very
wide range of uses, more than I can think of, but basically anywhere where you need something to look natural in origin.
What's more it's output can easily be tailored to suit your needs.

<dd>If you look at many things in nature, you will notice that they are fractal. They have various levels of detail.
A common example is the outline of a mountain range. It contains large variations in height (the mountains), medium
variations (hills), small variations (boulders), tiny variations (stones) . . . you could go on. Look at almost anything:
the distribution of patchy grass on a field, waves in the sea, the movements of an ant, the movement of branches of a tree,
patterns in marble, winds. All these phenomena exhibit the same pattern of large and small variations. The Perlin Noise
function recreates this by simply adding up noisy functions at a range of different scales.

<dd>To create a Perlin noise function, you will need two things, a Noise Function, and an Interpolation Function.</dd>

    <p>Really useful technique for lots of things. Definitely one to keep in the back of your brain.</p>
