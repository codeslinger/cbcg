 I don't want to become some huge bodybuilder freak, I just want to get in better shape and look better. Should I read this? 
<p>That's what this guide is for. It's a basic guide to diet &amp; fitness for beginners who want to get in better shape.
	If you want to look better, improve your overall athletic ability, or just improve your health, read on. If you're a
	bodybuilder or athlete, you probably already know most of this stuff.</p>
