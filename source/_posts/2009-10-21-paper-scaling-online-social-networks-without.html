<div class="posterous_bookmarklet_entry">
<blockquote class="posterous_long_quote">Online Social Networks (OSN) face serious scalability challenges due to their rapid growth and popularity. To address this issue we present a novel approach to scale up OSN called One Hop Replication (OHR). Our system combines partitioning and replication in a middleware to transparently scale up a centralized OSN design, and therefore, avoid the OSN application to undergo the costly transition to a fully distributed system to meet its scalability needs. OHR exploits some of the structural characteristics of Social Networks: 1) most of the information is one-hop away, and 2) the topology of the network of connections among people displays a strong community structure. We evaluate our system and its potential benefits and overheads using data from real OSNs: Twitter and Orkut. We show that OHR has the potential to provide out-of-the-box transparent scalability while maintaining the replication overhead costs in check.</blockquote></p><p><div class="posterous_quote_citation">via <a href="http://highscalability.com/blog/2009/10/16/paper-scaling-online-social-networks-without-pains.html" rel="nofollow">highscalability.com</a>

    <p>I found this paper very interesting, and not only because I work at an OSN (though that helped) ;-)</p>
