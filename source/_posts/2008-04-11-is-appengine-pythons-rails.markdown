title: Is AppEngine Python's Rails?

I was thinking about [AppEngine](http://code.google.com/appengine/) some more today and it occurred to me that not only could AppEngine be responsible for a lot of people learning/using Python, but it very well might be Python's answer to Rails. Its so-called "killer app", if you will.

Up until this point, Python has been plagued with multiple, competing Web frameworks all taking some mindshare and there really hasn't been a strong rallying point in the Python Web community like Rails. It appears that [Django](http://www.djangoproject.com/) has been winning out in the blogosphere lately, but its nothing like Rails' devout following in Ruby-land.

However, with AppEngine, Google does Rails one better: instead of just making it easy to code your app, they make it just as easy as Rails to code and *dirt simple* to deploy and reduce the operation maintenance to *near zero*. The need for things like ActiveRecord and migrations is pretty reduced in the AppEngine environment, as is all but a tiny knowledge of SQL (called GQL in that realm). That's really, really attractive if you're a Web consultancy shop that's looking to turn over clients as fast as possible or a side project with a mandate for speed, quality and low cost. To me, that seems like it would be worth learning a little Python for.

AppEngine is pretty clearly aimed at Facebook's F8 platform but it could end up hitting Python with a major boost in popularity as an aside. I bet Guido is smiling all the way to the bank on this one...
