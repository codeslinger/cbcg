Wow, Sun is really hitting on all cylinders lately. [Project Blackbox](http://www.itjungle.com/breaking/bn101706-story02.html) is an especially neat idea of putting a datacenter-sized array of boxes inside a portable box (in relative terms). I remember that Cringley was going off about Google building things like this for themself a while ago, but I never heard anything more about it. Now, anyone can grab one ;-) Man, they look good, too.
