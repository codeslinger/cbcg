<p>Operations is an interesting word. Outside of the field of IT it means something completely different than everywhere else in the business world. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_operations" rel="nofollow">According to Wikipedia</a>:</p></p><p><blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">
<p>Business operations encompasses three fundamental management imperatives that collectively aim to maximize value harvested from business assets</p></p><p><ul>
<li><p>Generate recurring income</p></li>
<li><p>Increase the value of the business assets</p></li>
<li><p>Secure the income and value of the business</p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote></p><p><p>IT operations traditionally does nothing in that regard. Instead IT operations has become about cock blocking and being greybeareded gatekeepers who always say “No” regardless of the question. We shunt the responsibility off to the development staff and then, in some sick game of ‘fuck you’, we do all we can to prevent the code from going live. This is unsustainable; counter-productive; and in a random twist of fate, self destructive.</p>
