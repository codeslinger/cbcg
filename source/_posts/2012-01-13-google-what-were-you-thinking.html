 The Sting 
<p>We decided to find out.Â We made some changes to the site:</p>
<ul>
<li>For visitors from the 41.203.221.138 address, we changed the code to serve slightly different content 10% of the time.</li>
<li>Instead of the real business phone number, we served a number that fed through to our call centre team, where the incoming calls would also be recorded. Our team were briefed to act like the business owners for the calls.</li>
</ul>
<p>We switched the new code on December 21st.</p>
<p>When we listened to the calls, we were beyond astonished.</p>
