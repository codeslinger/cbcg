I've been asked to speak at [Philly ETech](http://www.phillyemergingtech.com/) this year, and guess what? I agreed!

I'm on the Web 2.0 track on March 29th at 3:30 PM. I'll be talking about Comet, which is a technique for building super-low latency Web applications that allow for real-time collaboration between users.

The [schedule](http://www.phillyemergingtech.com/schedule.php) is up and so is my [abstract](http://www.phillyemergingtech.com/abstracts.php#dipasquale) along with what some might call a [bio](http://www.phillyemergingtech.com/speakers.php#dipasquale). And, if anyone wants to go but can't get a registration, I have one for both days so email me up and we can deal.
