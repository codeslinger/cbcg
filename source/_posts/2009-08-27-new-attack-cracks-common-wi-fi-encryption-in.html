<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">The <a href="http://dl.aircrack-ng.org/breakingwepandwpa.pdf" rel="nofollow">earlier attack</a>, developed by researchers Martin Beck and Erik Tews, worked on a smaller range of WPA devices and took between 12 and 15 minutes to work. Both attacks work only on WPA systems that use the Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP) algorithm. They do not work on newer WPA 2 devices or on WPA systems that use the stronger Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm.</blockquote>
