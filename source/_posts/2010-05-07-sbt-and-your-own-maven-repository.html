<p>To make the my libraries accessible to others, I could simply place the jar
file somewhere, such as the "download" area of the project's <a href="http://www.github.com/" rel="nofollow">GitHub</a>
repository. This works fine, as long as the jar has no dependencies.
However, if my jar depends on other libraries, anyone using my code has to
chase down and install those dependencies. A better solution is to create
and deploy a <a href="http://maven.apache.org/" rel="nofollow">Maven</a> file, since the POM file will capture those
dependencies.</p>
<p>As it happens, SBT has excellent support for Maven. It will generate a POM
automatically, and it will publish to a Maven repository. In most cases,
you never have to write a single line of Maven XML; SBT handles all that
for you.</p>
