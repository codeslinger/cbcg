I'm here at [WWW2007](http://www2007.org) and so far its been really good. Here are some of the better papers I've seen so far:

[Google News Personalization: Scalable Online Collaborative Filtering](http://www2007.org/paper570.php)

[Navigation Aided Retrieval](http://www2007.org/program/paper.php?id=162)

I wanted to see these, but missed them:

[Visibly Pushdown Automata for Streaming XML](http://www2007.org/program/paper.php?id=788)

[CSurf: A Context-Driven Non-Visual Web-Browser](http://www2007.org/program/paper.php?id=649)

The hallway and evening beer conversations have been really great, as well. And, of course, the view's not bad, either ;-) I can't send the pics from my phone while I'm here in Canada, but I will post some when I get back.
