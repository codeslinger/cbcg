<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">We have extended Cassandra database system with support for Asynchronous Triggers (<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-1311" rel="nofollow">CASSANDRA-1311</a>). Asynchronous triggers is a basic mechanism that can be used to implement various use cases of asynchronous execution of application code at database side. Cassandra and Async triggers are a perfect match as they both exploit advantages out of eventual data consistency.</blockquote></p><p><div class="posterous_quote_citation">via <a href="http://maxgrinev.com/2010/07/23/extending-cassandra-with-asynchronous-triggers/" rel="nofollow">maxgrinev.com</a>
