This weekend, I was writing a paper that required some mathematical equations be shown. Apple's [Pages](http://www.apple.com/iwork/pages/) does not have an equation editor like Word does. So I fired up Word. Oops, I forgot to install it and the CD is back at the office. Damn.

Then, I figured I'd try LaTeX, but it was a hassle to generate the images the normal way. So I whipped up this little browser-based [LaTeX->PNG formula generator](http://cbcg.net/code/formula_editor.html) so I could just drag and drop the generated images into my documents. I thought it was semi-neato so I've posted it up for all to see. There's even a screenshot ;-) Have fun with it.
