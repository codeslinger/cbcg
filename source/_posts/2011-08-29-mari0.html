 About Mari0 
Two genre defining games from completely different eras: Nintendo's Super Mario Bros. and Valve's Portal. 
These two games managed to give Platformers and First-Person Puzzle Games a solid place in the video game world. 
But what if Nintendo teamed up with Valve and recreated the famous Mario game with Portal gun mechanics?
<p>
A complete from scratch recreation of Super Mario Bros. with a focus on perfectly imitating the feel the 1985 classic gave us. 
Then give Mario a portal gun, add puzzle game mechanics from Portal and there you go. 
And if that wasn't crazy enough, play simultaneously with as many friends as you can connect joypads to your PC, with everyone having their own Portal gun!
