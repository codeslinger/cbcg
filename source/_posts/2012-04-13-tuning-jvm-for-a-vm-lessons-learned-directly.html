    <p><a href="https://twitter.com/#!/bensdoings" rel="nofollow">Ben Corrie</a> from <a href="http://www.vmware.com/" rel="nofollow">VMware</a>  gave a talk on March 15, 2012 at the <a href="http://www.sfjava.org/" rel="nofollow">San Francisco Java Usergroup</a> on <a href="http://www.sfjava.org/events/49382802/" rel="nofollow">tuning the JVM for a virtual machine</a>. The event was filled to capacity, but fortunately you can find the video, slides, and a more detailed description of the talk below.</p>
<p><cite><em>The number of Java workloads running on virtualized infrastructure has been increasing exponentially over the last few years. Advancements in processors and hypervisor technology now make virtualizing Java a compelling proposition. However, there are still best practice provisos and considerations, particularly in the area of JVM memory management.</em></cite></p>
<p><cite><em>This talk will present a lot of the innovation, practical insight, and lessons learned gained from the last year by a senior engineer from VMware who recently developed a Java "ballooning" solution called Elastic Memory for Java (EM4J)</em></cite></p></p><p><p> </p>
