<div class="posterous_bookmarklet_entry">
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">The	beauty	of this essay is that although the romanized version is utterly
ridiculous, its Chinese character version is perfectly clear and its content
totally interesting. However, it is up to you to find out  whether a native
Chinese speaker hearing the essay for the first time could correctly parse it
 when
read by another native Chinese speaker.</blockquote></p><p><div class="posterous_quote_citation">via <a href="http://www.yellowbridge.com/onlinelit/stonelion.php" rel="nofollow">yellowbridge.com</a>
