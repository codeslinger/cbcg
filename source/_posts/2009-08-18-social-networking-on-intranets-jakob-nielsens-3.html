<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">
<p>Through several rounds of <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/portals.html" rel="nofollow">research on intranet portals</a>, we've repeatedly reached the same conclusions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>When <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/ia.html" rel="nofollow">Intranet information architectures</a> are structured according to the org chart, employees have a hard time finding their way around. It's better to structure information according to how people use it, rather than what department owns it.
</li>
<li>Role-based personalization lets portals bring information to users in centralized views, rather than forcing users to navigate an immense information space to find individual (and dispersed) locations.
</li>
</ul>
Social features on intranets take these two trends a step further, creating a <strong>"person-structured" intranet IA</strong> focused around the individual users as well as other people on the intranet.</blockquote></p><p><div class="posterous_quote_citation">via <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/social-intranet-features.html" rel="nofollow">useit.com</a>

    <p>CubeTree fares extremely well in comparison with other tools out there according to this article. ;-)</p>
