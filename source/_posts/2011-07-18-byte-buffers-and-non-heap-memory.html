<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote"><p>Most Java programs spend their time working with objects on the JVM heap,
    using getter and setter methods to retrieve or change the data in those
    objects. A few programs, however, need to do something different. Perhaps
    they're exchanging data with a program written in C. Or they need to manage
    large chunks of data without the risk of garbage collection pauses. Or
    maybe they need efficient random access to files. For all these programs,
    a <code>java.nio.ByteBuffer</code> is an alternative to traditional Java
    objects.</p><p></p></blockquote></p><p><div class="posterous_quote_citation">via <a href="http://www.kdgregory.com/index.php?page=java.byteBuffer" rel="nofollow">kdgregory.com</a>
