I gave that talk last night to the [Philly Lambda](http://groups.google.com/group/philly-lambda) group and about 15 people showed up! It seemed like people were into it and enjoyed the presentation and I hope people got a more rounded perspective on what its like to work with EC2 for real, day to day. The slides are listed on my [talks](http://cbcg.net/talks) page; enjoy!
