<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">I spent two weeks reading and reverse engineering further the <a href="https://github.com/fabiensanglard/Another-World-Bytecode-Interpreter" rel="nofollow">
			source code of Another World</a> ("Out Of This World" in North America). I
			based my work on Gregory Montoir's "binary to C++" initial reverse engineering from the DOS executable.<p>
			
			I was amazed to discover an elegant system based on a virtual machine interpreting bytecode in realtime and generating fullscreen vectorial 
			cinematic in order to produce one of the best game of all time.</p>
<p>
			
			All this shipping on a 1.44MB floppy disk and running within 600KB of RAM: Not bad for 1991 ! As usual I cleaned up my notes, it may save a few hours to someone.</p>
