title: "Google Code: Just Because Its There Doesn't Mean Google Wrote It"

I've been noticing a bunch of references lately attributing projects on [Google Code](http://code.google.com) to Google itself. Google Code does indeed house a bunch of open source projects from Google itself, but it now also houses lots more projects from random developers across the Web. Think of it as Google's version of [SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net). 

So remember: _just because you see it on Google Code doesn't mean someone at Google was responsible for it_.

This is not a knock on Google Code, of course. I have two projects up there and I like it so far.
