I was just reading about [In/Out, 37signals' internal Twitter clone](http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/976-a-peek-at-inout-an-internal-app-at-37signals) over on their blog and it struck me how they sometimes mutilate context in their writings. First of all, DHH knows the Twitter guys well. Second of all, they didn't even mention that it was inspired by Twitter and even went so far as to refute this in the comments. I guess a place that's know for its "creativity" has to keep up the appearances of being innovative...

*UPDATE:* Apparently, as the comments state, I am wrong about this. My bad. Nevermind this post.
