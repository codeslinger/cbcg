My startup [Commerce360](http://www.commerce360.com/) is one of the seven finalists for the [Amazon Startup Challenge](http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html?node=377634011) out of close to a thousand entries. I'm very excited that we made the finals of this contest and I'm looking forward to going out to Seattle to pitch our company to Amazon and see what they think.
